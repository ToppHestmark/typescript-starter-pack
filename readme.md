# Typescript beginner class

Teaching myself some typescript typing language.

## Core Types

- Number
- String
- Boolean
- object
- Array
- Tuple: ~ Added Typescript fixed length array ~
- Enum: ~ Added by Typescript, automatically enumerated global constant identifiers ~
- Any: ~ Any unspecified value ~

## Other Types

- Union ~ Accepting two different kind of values ~
- Literal ~ The clear exact value ~
- Alias ~ Name/variable for combined types of value ~
  --- [x] Example: type Combinable = number; (etc.) ~ start with 'type' ~
- Functions ~ Show us the return value of expected output type ~
  --- [x] Can also be stored in a variable
  --- [x] () => string; (etc.)
  --- [x] (a: number, b: number) => number; (example of callback function with parameters)
- unknown ~ Common use for user input, a stricter type of any ~
- never ~ never return anything, a code that never return anything ~
